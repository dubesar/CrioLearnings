#Running ls command without appending any argument will list current working directory contents.
ls

#To list contents of any directory, for example /etc directory use:
ls /etc


#A directory always contains a few hidden files (at least two), therefore, to show all files in a directory, use the -a or --all flag:
ls -a

#You can as well print detailed information about each file in the ls output, such as the file permissions, number of links, ownerâ€™s name and group owner, file size, time of last modification and the file/directory name.
ls -l

#To list files in a directory and sort them last modified date and time, make use of the -t option as in the command below
ls -lt

# If you want a reverse sorting files based on date and time, you can use the -r option to work like so:
ls -ltr
